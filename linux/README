Ubuntu Minimak Keymaps

Allows minimak keyboard layouts to be loaded from 'System Settings'->'Keyboard
Layout'

cd minimak/linux
sudo cp evdev.lst /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/
sudo cp evdev.xml /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/

if you are in the UK:
sudo cp gb /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

if you are in the US:
sudo cp us /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/

If you are worried about overwriting the existing xkb files then do a diff first
to check you are happy with things
