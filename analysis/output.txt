becoming a software developer.  it's a challenge and an opportunity to grow because i get to do a little of everything, including marketing.  i spent the day working on logo design for our new product, which was tiring but pretty exciting for me.the outside marketing stuff has definitely taken a back seat, obviously.  i'd love to be as involved as possible in everything i take an interest in, but i can only really devote myself to a few things and unfortunately the pdma has taken a back seat.  i feel bad about because mike's such a great guy and i wish it success but that's

money.  i would do the same if the roles were reversed.more below:lillian pierson wrote:i'm sorry you feel that way.  i can see we don't see eye to eye on this, because twice you have rejected me!  isn't it funny how we can see the same situation so differently.  this has been my experience in all relationships, so i'm not trying to argue.  understand that the other person is sometimes just as sensitive and is taking actions not designed to hurt you but to protect them.  strong emotions for someone can lead to getting hurt, so sometimes we cut ourselves off from the person so that doesn't happen.but the thing is, we both like each other a lot!  what's the rejection there?  in reality there is none, we are still friends and still like each other as much as ever (well, i guess i can only speak for myself there.  but i do.).  there are only fears and hurt egos to cloud it, self-inflicted.  that's the danger.  it's easier to put my ego aside because i know you have only good intentions for me.after having been rejected by you the last time ( i won't make my case for why i felt that way), that night at the coffee shop i only had hope for physical intimacy with you, not more.  that hope was based on having been taken to bed that first night (literally, you pulled me in there! :):), which left me very affected.  yes, i held out hope for recreating the last night with you.  with sex this time. ;)  i was only investigating that possibility though, not expecting it.on a side note, i've been with women where there was no spark like ours.  passion like we had is rare and means (to me) something more than just sex is going on.  but no matter, that is passed.back to that night, part of me wanted to be close to you.  i wanted to have sex with you, to hold you, kiss you and caress you.  you made it clear you didn't want that and that was fine.  i wasn't mad.  i had plans to see my family, so i needed to drive to mt dora before it was too late and i would disturb them coming in.  if we were to hang out more than we already had, i could have asked you to let me stay over that evening but i would have needed to go right to sleep and leave early which would have defeated the point of hanging out.  also, as i said, i know myself enough to know that i would work on you to kiss me, hold me or whatever else.  i felt i would end up disrespecting your wishes and i didn't want to put either of us through that since you made your wishes clear.fyi, and this is not a dig at you, but good girls don't bring guys home late at night to hang out.  you'll attract the wrong kind of attention that way.  not many guys would pass on any opportunity to get close to your pj's (believe me, it was hard).  i don't think you considered what i wanted to happen when you invited me home and most men would not have made it clear like i did.  that's true in general: if a man is looking for intimacy and you don't want it, not inviting him home late at night is a good policy.  you should take that seriously, as it could put you in danger.believe it or not, i haven't changed at all since the first two times.  the guy you like now is the same as i was then.and thanks.  i am awesome. ;):)in all seriousness, i think you're really a wonderful person and am truly amazed by who you've become since i've known you.  really, i'm in awe.  i'll say it again so you understand: i'm in awe of you.  and that's not about the sex.i can tell.  with everything that's happened to you, i think you are just like your horse, conditioned to spook.  unfortunately, i spooked you and that rarely goes away.  that's why i was so touched when you called me after your mom passed.  i'm so grateful i could be there to help you when you needed it.i hope in the future however, that you can understand the other person's situation a bit better, because i'm not a bad person and what went on between us was a natural course of events.  there wasn't a rejection of you...i think you're great(!) and accept you the way you are.  that acceptance of you and myself for what we are ended up feeling like rejection to you, because i made a decision i felt was in both our best interests.  god sometimes works that way and it's not about us, just the situation.in another life it might have really been something.  but in this one we should both make it a learning experience.  i hope to be your friend always.with love,tedhi zane,my name is ted lilley.  my friend jessalyn pearsall contacted me about your situation with the

little second cousins.  they're both seven, which is the perfect age for it.  they were both tall enough to go on most of the rides and were so excited about the whole thing.  it was pretty funny being the center of attention with them too.  we would be walking along, and one of them would grab his mother's hand, look up and say, "oh, that's not who i wanted!" and would come hold my hand.  "what am i, chopped liver?!?" his mom would say. :) so funny.i spent the other day in mt. dora with my father's sister and some of my father's friends i remember from when i was a kid.  it was very pleasant.  we tooled about the lake and went through the canal that joins two lakes.  lots of homes line the canal, so you can wave at the residents, but we also saw some fantastic wildlife there

feel otherwise, please let me know rather than let me hang.  thanks,tedhello my dear,it's time for me to write a letter i don't want to write.  the short of it is that i need to break things off, at least for the time being.  by time being, i mean at least until your situation is less complicated.what has lead me to this conclusion are my discussions with my friends.  naturally i have been telling my friends what is going on in my life, and now that i'm mostly better from being sick, i've been doing that a lot more.  while it is clear when i explain the situation how things got to where they are, there is one fact that is unchangeable and which makes me very uncomfortable when i explain it.  that is the fact that i've been talking romantically to a married woman.  no matter how i cast it to others or myself, it doesn't sit right.i know we've covered that territory before, and i know that we've agreed to bring things down to a friendly level.  however, i can't kid myself that when i talk about you, it falls under the subject of relationships and my love life.  that's the basis of our interest, and that is true no matter however we may act.  it's not the how of our interaction that is the matter, it's the why, and the why has always been in conflict with your marital status.i can't change the situation so i must accept it and behave accordingly.  while i've wanted to be friendly and leave open communication, i can't.  we've crossed a line that can't be uncrossed.  the only thing that is right for me to do is to leave you alone.  that means i won't be responding for a while.  it pains me to say that, but it's what i feel i have to do.i must also apologize for making the decision to pursue you under the current circumstances.  upon reflection, it wasn't the right decision, and whatever influence that has had on you can't serve a good purpose.  i was in no position to promise you anything in the future.  for that i apologize.  if there were a way i could make that up to you, i would, but i believe in the current circumstances the best i can do is to politely bow out.rest assured that i've been honest with you throughout, so there is no need to second guess anything i've said.  i've had to struggle through a conflict between my desires, emotions and principles, and i haven't done as well as i would have liked.  it's taken longer than i would have liked, but i think principles are what must prevail and that is only now the case.so, for now at least, this is goodbye.  i can't promise you anything about the future except that i'm sure we will talk again and that you will have my friendship.  i know you will come out the other side of this trying time for you.my best,tedkaterina munzar

face.tedhi there,hope you are doing ok.  i know you're going through a tough time, i've been there.  i got your message about moving out and your consideration on where to go next.  sometimes i've gotten your messages directly and not responded, others i've come back to my computer to find them left there.  in any case, i can see you're moving along your path and i should let you know what's going with me.at this point, i don't think you should make plans based around me.  i say that because, while i don't regret our conversations in the past and i think there are a lot of things we have in common, i'm not at the point where a relationship with you would be something i could pursue, for two reasons.  the first is that the high emotion i was feeling at the time has cooled, and there would definitely be long periods of both you getting your bearings after the divorce as well as us basically starting over from scratch.  i can't say it would be the same this time around, i don't know.  in some sense, the fact that i was ill and sleep-deprived made me more emotional than i usually am, and at this point i don't feel the feelings i was at that time.  i'm not saying there wasn't anything there in the first place, i'm just saying that the tape has rewound to the beginning and it might play differently given the change in circumstances.the second reason is just as important, if not more so.  i've met someone and we have been seeing each other.  she is a very sweet woman and i want to continue seeing her.  while i don't know what the future holds and every relationship faces challenges, i'm willing to see where it goes with her.  while the two of us are not in a formal relationship, i'm consciously not pursuing other opportunities right now in favor of her.  she is special to me.i know this will be disappointing news to you and it isn't meant to hurt you in any way, of course.  i'm hoping for the best for you and like you a lot.  under different circumstances, things might have more easily worked out between us.  who knows what the future holds.  but for the moment, i'm on a different path.my best hugs and kisses,tedlooking forward to it!tedi can buy it for $100.  let me know if you are interested.thanks,tedhttp://tampa.craigslist.org/hil/ele/1469952534.htmlhi patrick,i apologize for never having responded to you.your offer is very generous, and i'm flattered that you should make the offer.there are two reasons for not taking you up on the offer is that we're simply not at that level of sophistication yet.  i think we will soon be needing code metrics in the near future, but we are climbing the learning curve of several new tools at the moment and just aren't to that kind of tool yet.the second is that we are currently a vb6 shop.  this is going to need to change in the future, but again, we're just not there yet.  i'm hoping this changes very soon, but my hopes may not have anything to do with it.at the point at which we can use tools such as yours, i would be pleased to evaluate your tools.  i hope at that point your offer may stand.until then,ted

non-collaborative) prototyping.i am a blogger, although i do it for purposes of sharing my experiences as opposed to looking for any kind of recognition or commercial purpose.  to my surprise, actually, my blog (blogs.trekforth.com) appears in the first or second page of google search results for search term for combinations of my favorite topics, "sql", "redmine" and "subversion", mostly due to my interest in redmine.  my blog has gotten me an unsolicited request to review code metrics tools, ndepend (which i did not take up because my company is not yet at that level of sophistication).i've already considered and used several different tools, including:* creately* hotgloo* mockupflow* mockupscreens* pencil* serena prototype composer* inkscapei'm looking for a _simple_ tool that will allow collaborative development of the user-interface experience.  the tool should easily integrate with our existing documentation method, which is wiki-based (redmine's wiki).things i find important:* inexpensive* complete widget set* easily adaptable widgets* wireframe feel* collaboratively editable at a click or two, preferably without software install (annotation a plus)* easily integrated with redmine wiki* low learning curveeach of the tools i've used so far lacks in some respect.  i'd like to evaluate balsamiq further.  i've used the online version and it looks promising.  i've downloaded the desktop application and would like to be able to use it more extensively to test it out.  i see the web-based version as more suitable for collaboration, but the desktop version will work fine for evaluation purposes.please let me know if you would issue me a free license.  i will write up my experience either way, but i'm sure the

price.  unfortunately it's sold out until february, but you can preorder them and i wanted to do this.  it combines the features of the kindle with free 3g wireless for delivery of books, the ability to get books from your local library for free (if they offer ebooks) and the ability to browse the full books when you are at a borders store.  the price is $260, which is very reasonable for the market.  it can store hundreds of books, the battery life is about 4 days of use per charge and new books can be purchased wirelessly from b&n for about $10.i was also going to purchase a

my place is big enough now.  if you're not far, i'll keep you in mind for invites.glad to hear you are busy and well,tedhttp://tampabay.brighthouse.com/g2b/default.aspxlooks like you have to buy bundles of 2-3 services.  that's ok, we can break down the pricing from the list as follows:base price: $40  (we pay this for the pleasure of doing business with them)phone: + $5internet:  +$15tv:  +$40if you look at the menu, it breaks down like this:tv + phone is $85 on the websitetv + phone + base$40 + $5 + $40 = $85internet + phone is $60 on the websiteinternet + phone + base$15    +    $5      + $40 = $60tv + internet is $95 on the websitetv + internet + base$40 + $15      + $40 = $95all three is $100tv + internet + phone + base$40 + $15      + $5      + $40   = $100so the pricing makes sense no matter which package you choose.if we're on one of these packages, then we should split the base and internet, and tv would be on your tab.  that would make it:base        +  internet     + tv1/2 * $40 + 1/2 * $15                     for me = $27.50 ish1/2 * $40 + 1/2 * $15 + $40           for you = $67.50 ishwe can discuss more later.tedwhoops.

tampa resident and musician who has been contemplating ways to combine the exercise of my musical talents with giving to the community.  this led me to do some research on organizations in the area which specialize in care for the elderly.i came across the article in the st. petersburg times which discussed the case of roger george, the 93-year old with no identification who was sheltered by your hospice.  i was heartened by the story and think that yours is the kind of organization with which i would like to be associated.by way of contributing, i would like to perform for your clients.  i don't know if you have any kind of musical program or entertainment there on a regular basis, but if so, i would be glad to talk with the coordinator.i am an individual performer.  i sing and play acoustic guitar.  i'm acoustic only, no electric, although i do use amplification if appropriate.  my style is palatable to young and old alike, although it seems to resonate more with older audiences.my repertoire of songs is tasteful and is universally received as warm and inviting.  it draws on a variety of folk, contemporary and jazz sources.while i am not a professional in the sense that i don't make my income as a performer (i'm a software developer, of all things), my capability level is definitely performance-worthy and recognized as such by both professional musicians and audiences alike.i perform frequently, both for my own pleasure as well as for local events.  it is not uncommon for me to receive enthusiastic feedback for having playing on the street or a cafe.  venues i have played (or am booked to play) include cafes, weddings, yoga studios and farmer's markets as well as events for other community organizations.if you could use my services, i would like to talk more.  by services, i mean volunteer services of course.i would enjoy meeting you and seeing your facility.  my phone number is 813-810-2879 and email is ted.lilley@gmail.com.ted   hi susan,finally got the lineup for the 25th.1pm colleen hart - music.myspace.com/colleenhartmusic2pm algorhythm skyi'll get the bios for both.have a good time at the

being.i'm living in tampa now, single after having been divorced for a few years and working as a software developer.  i also perform music now, i play guitar and sing which is a terrific pastime.no kids or family.  hopefully i'll purchase a house in the not too distant future.let me know what's going on with you,tedon 3/27/2010 2:57 pm, thomas capozzoli wrote:looking forward to

on the aa recently.  i need to get into a routine here in my new neighborhood.  music threatens to swallow my time if i'm not careful.i haven't wanted to chat much lately and i'm sure that's disappointing.  the reasons are, of course, my own, and mostly i'm just more interested in talking frequently with the people i know here.  not that i don't enjoy chatting once in a while, but you've definitely been more interested than i am.  i know how big a transition you're going through right now, and to really be there for a friend in need isn't characteristic for me.  i'm getting the feeling that there isn't much i can do to help, either.  i feel like i need to keep a certain distance in order to not be more than a friendly interest for you.i guess i would appreciate it if you could let me initiate with you every once in a while, and let it go after a couple tries if i don't.  i can be your friend, but i need to feel like our desire to communicate is mutual, and sometimes i just need to wait until i feel moved to talk with you.i hope you are well.  please tell me about your new place.lilleyt<br />ted.lilley@gmail.com<br /><br

that he remembered me.  it's been over a year since i've stopped in, since i moved away from the temple terrace area.you may remember me as well.  we figured out that we had darrin guilbeau as a friend in common, and i used to stop in from time to time.  i love the cream assam you guys had and was sad to see it's gone from the menu.in any case, i'm a performer now and part of the reason i was stopping by was to find out if i could book a night there at kaleisia.  bruce said to email you, so here i am.  i'm starting to play on a regular basis, definitely coffee/tea shop kind of music, acoustic and mellow.  i've gotten a lot of praise for my voice and song selection, and have been doing gigs at actual venues.  i've played on the lineup at skipper's (not headlining), as well as places like sweetwater organic farm's music series, cafe kili, sacred grounds coffeehouse, dishtopia tea and dish shop and at special events.i have a website where you can hear a couple recordings of me and see my event schedule.  it's at http://www.tedlilley.com/.  it's in the process of being built, so please forgive any hiccups.  i have two recordings available now, one which is representative of my current capabilities and one that's a bit older but still good.i have one opening this month on friday and next month is clear.  i hope we can do something, i have fond memories of kaleisia and would be enthusiastic to play for you.tedhi,brian has volunteered to be the primary as the treasurer for our group, and since you already wear two other hats in the
